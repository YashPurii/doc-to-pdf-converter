## Deployment

### Using Docker
1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t doc-to-pdf:latest .
   ```
2. Run the Docker container:
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name doc-to-pdf doc-to-pdf:latest
   ```

### Using Kubernetes
1. Push the Docker image to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub):
   ```bash
   docker tag doc-to-pdf <your-dockerhub-username>/doc-to-pdf:latest
   docker push <your-dockerhub-username>/doc-to-pdf:latest
   ```
2. Apply the Kubernetes manifest:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f deployment/kubernetes_manifest.yaml
   ```
3. Verify the deployment:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods
   kubectl get services
   ```
